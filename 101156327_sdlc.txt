This file will contain details about important of learning DevOps engineer in software development cycle:
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of two main phases: development and operation. These two stages are relatively separate from each other, especially in mid-sized companies and above.
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operation (Ops).
DevOps helps perfect the transition of software development and operation process from "waterfall" to "continuous development/releases".
Besides, DevOps helps:
- Enhancing the substantial collaboration between development and operation, as well as cross-functional
- Increasing the frequency of deployment
- Taking advantage of automation tools to help limit risks and reduce failure rates
- Faster product recovery time
So DevOps helps optimize Software Development Life Cycle.
